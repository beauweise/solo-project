Description Duration: 2 Week Sprint

The app that I created allows you to create a Musky fishing journal. You are able to register and login. When logged in you can make an entry to the history page. The home/history page allows you check specific entries for more information, or you can edit or delete each entry. If the user has lots of entries they are able to filter the list by selecting the dropdown and selecting a specific lake to only see entries of that lake.

Prerequisites: 

I used: Javascript, Node.js, Express, Axios, React, React-Redux, Redux-saga, Material UI.

Installation:

To get started make sure you have Node.js, PostrgeSQL Nodemon. Installed on your computer.

Once you have that installed run the database.sql file in PostgreSQL. Then Run npm install.Start postgres if not running already by using brew services start postgresql, Run npm run server to start the server, Run npm run client to start the client Navigate to localhost:3000.
